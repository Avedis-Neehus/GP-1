# GP-1
Here you can find the code I used to analyze and plot the data taken in the first semester physics lab. It is currently uncommented and unstructured, I'll try to correct that in the future.
Note that the core file is table.py, there you can find some useful functions and decorators. For example a decorator that outputs the error propagation of a function in TeX. The other text files correspond to the actual processing and plotting of data taken in each experiment. You may use it by copying it to table.py or using a *-import.
